## 📞 Communication Guidelines

### Daily Updates
Each agent should update their status section above at end of each development session.

### Coordination Needed
- API contract changes → Update `docs/06-API-SPECIFICATION.yaml`
- Database schema changes → Update `docs/05-COMPLETE-DATABASE-SCHEMA.sql`
- New dependencies → Update respective configuration files
- Integration issues → Update `docs/integration-points.md`

### Emergency Escalation
Tag issues with `@urgent` only for:
- Blocking dependencies between agents

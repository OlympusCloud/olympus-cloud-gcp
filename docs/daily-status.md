- 🚫 **Blockers**: None
📝 **Notes**: Monitoring and CI/CD validation are now in place, improving observability and code quality. The next focus is completing module refactoring and adding cost controls.
📝 **Notes**: The BigQuery dataset and tables are now provisioned via a new `analytics` module. The Cloud Run service account has been granted the necessary permissions. The data warehouse is ready for the Python service to begin populating it.
📝 **Notes**: A new `security` module now centralizes the creation and management of sensitive values like the database password and JWT secret. These are generated randomly and stored in GCP Secret Manager, removing the need to pass them in as root variables and significantly improving our security posture.
📝 **Notes**: The CI/CD pipeline in GitHub Actions has been enhanced with a `validate` job that runs `tfsec` for static analysis of Terraform code. This will help catch potential security misconfigurations before they are deployed.

## 📞 Communication Guidelines

### Daily Updates
Each agent should update their status section above at end of each development session.

### Coordination Needed
- API contract changes → Update `docs/06-API-SPECIFICATION.yaml`
- Database schema changes → Update `docs/05-COMPLETE-DATABASE-SCHEMA.sql`
- New dependencies → Update respective configuration files
- Integration issues → Update `docs/integration-points.md`

### Emergency Escalation
Tag issues with `@urgent` only for:
- Blocking dependencies between agents
- Security vulnerabilities
- Architecture conflicts
- External service failures

## 📞 Communication Guidelines

### Daily Updates
Each agent should update their status section above at end of each development session.

### Coordination Needed
- API contract changes → Update `docs/06-API-SPECIFICATION.yaml`
- Database schema changes → Update `docs/05-COMPLETE-DATABASE-SCHEMA.sql`
- New dependencies → Update respective configuration files
- Integration issues → Update `docs/integration-points.md`

### Emergency Escalation
Tag issues with `@urgent` only for:
- Blocking dependencies between agents
- Security vulnerabilities
- Architecture conflicts
- External service failures

---

**Remember**: We're building the future of business software. Quality over speed. Documentation over assumptions. Coordination over individual heroics.

**🎉 MILESTONE ACHIEVED**: AI Agent coordination system operational, Go API Gateway foundation deployed, all worktrees synchronized!

*Next Update Due: After next development session*

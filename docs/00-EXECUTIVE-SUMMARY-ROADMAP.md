- Security built-in, not bolted-on
- Documentation as you go
- Code reviews mandatory

### 3. Modular Boundaries
- Clear separation between modules
- Well-defined interfaces
- Schema-per-module database design
- Event-driven communication

### 4. Production-Ready from Day 1
- Docker from the start
- CI/CD pipeline immediately
- Monitoring and logging built-in
- Security scanning automated

## üéØ Getting Started NOW

### For All AI Agents:

1. **Read Documentation**
   ```bash
   cd /Users/scotthoughton/olympus-cloud/olympus-repos/olympus-cloud-gcp/docs
   # Read files 01 through 07 in order
   ```

2. **Setup Workspace**
   ```bash
   # Create your git worktree
   git worktree add -b feat/your-module worktree-yourname
   cd worktree-yourname
   ```

3. **Start Development**
   - Claude Code: Start with auth module
   - GitHub Copilot: Create Flutter project
   - Google Gemini: Setup GCP project
   - OpenAI Codex: Initialize Python structure
   - ChatGPT: Create Go API skeleton

4. **Daily Routine**
   - Morning: Sync and plan
   - Day: Develop and test
   - Evening: Commit and document

## üö¶ Critical Path

**These MUST be completed first (in order):**

1. ‚úÖ Documentation (COMPLETE)
2. üîÑ GCP Project Setup (Google Gemini - START NOW)
3. üîÑ Database Schema (Claude Code - START NOW)
4. üîÑ Auth Service (Claude Code - After DB)
5. üîÑ API Gateway (ChatGPT - After Auth)
6. üîÑ Flutter Shell (GitHub Copilot - In parallel)

**Then parallel development of:**
- Commerce Module
- Customer Module
- Inventory Module
- Analytics Module

## üìù Final Notes

### Remember the Vision
We're not building another SaaS platform. We're building technology that understands and adapts to humans. Every line of code should advance this vision.

### Communication is Key
- Update `/docs/daily-status.md` every day
- Document integration points
- Ask for help when blocked
- Celebrate wins together

### Quality Standards
- No code without tests
- No features without documentation
- No deployment without monitoring
- No shortcuts, ever

### The NebusAI Way
"The future of software isn't about teaching humans to think like computers. It's about building computers that understand humans."

## 📅 Weekly Milestones

### Week 1 Goals (Days 1-7)
- [ ] **Database schema deployed and accessible**
- [ ] **All services containerized and running locally**
- [ ] **Authentication service functional with JWT**
- [ ] **API Gateway routing requests correctly**
- [ ] **Basic analytics collecting events**

### Week 2 Goals (Days 8-14)
- [ ] **Complete business logic in all Rust services**
- [ ] **GraphQL API fully functional**
- [ ] **Real-time features working via WebSocket**
- [ ] **ML models deployed and serving recommendations**
- [ ] **Flutter app showing basic data**

- [ ] **Documentation complete**

## 🚨 Risk Assessment

### High Risk Items
1. **Database Schema Complexity** - Multiple agents need coordination
2. **Service Communication** - HTTP clients and error handling
3. **Authentication Integration** - Cross-service JWT validation
4. **Real-time Features** - WebSocket + Redis coordination

### Medium Risk Items
1. **Performance Requirements** - Sub-100ms response times
2. **Multi-tenant Security** - Row-level security implementation
3. **ML Model Training** - Data availability and model accuracy
4. **Cross-platform Frontend** - Flutter deployment complexity

### Low Risk Items
1. **Infrastructure Automation** - Terraform is well-documented
2. **Basic CRUD Operations** - Standard patterns
3. **Monitoring Setup** - GCP native tools
4. **Documentation** - Can be done in parallel

## 🔧 Daily Coordination Protocol

### Morning Standup (All Agents)
1. **Check status documents:**
   - `docs/BACKEND-STATUS.md`
   - `docs/INFRASTRUCTURE-STATUS.md`
   - `docs/COORDINATION-STATUS.md` (this file)

2. **Update your task list:**
   - Mark completed tasks
   - Add any new blockers
   - Update timeline estimates

3. **Review dependencies:**
   - Check if any dependencies are ready
   - Notify other agents of your completions
   - Plan integration testing

### Development Standards
1. **Commit Messages:** Use conventional commits (feat:, fix:, docs:)
2. **Testing:** Write tests for all new functionality
3. **Documentation:** Update API docs for any changes
4. **Security:** Follow security best practices
5. **Performance:** Monitor response times and resource usage

### Communication Channels
- **Task Updates:** Update individual task files

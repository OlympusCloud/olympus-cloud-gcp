# üõ°Ô∏è Security Incident Response Plan

*Status: DRAFT*
*Last Updated: Current Session*

This document outlines the procedure for responding to security incidents within the Olympus Cloud platform. The goal is to provide a clear, actionable plan to detect, contain, eradicate, and recover from security threats efficiently.

## 1. Roles and Responsibilities

- **Incident Commander (IC)**: The senior engineer on-call. Responsible for coordinating the response effort, making key decisions, and managing communications.
- **Technical Lead (TL)**: The subject matter expert for the affected system(s). Responsible for technical investigation and remediation.
- **Communications Lead (CL)**: Responsible for internal and external communications (if necessary).

## 2. Incident Severity Levels

| Level | Name | Description | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **SEV-1** | Critical | Active customer data breach, widespread service outage, system compromise. | Production database credentials leaked; Ransomware attack. |
| **SEV-2** | High | Potential for data exposure, significant service degradation, critical vulnerability. | SQL injection vulnerability discovered; Staging environment compromised. |
| **SEV-3** | Medium | Minor service impact, non-critical vulnerability, suspicious activity detected. | A developer's laptop with code access is stolen; Sustained DDoS attempt. |
| **SEV-4** | Low | Security misconfiguration with low impact, informational alert. | A non-sensitive GCS bucket is accidentally made public. |

## 3. Incident Response Phases

### Phase 1: Detection & Triage

1.  **Detection**: An incident can be detected via:
    -   **Automated Alerts**: GCP Monitoring, Cloudflare WAF, `tfsec` CI/CD failures.
    -   **Manual Discovery**: A user or employee reports suspicious activity.
    -   **External Report**: A third-party security researcher reports a vulnerability.
2.  **Triage**: The on-call engineer receives the alert/report.
    -   Confirm the incident is real and not a false positive.
    -   Assess the initial impact and assign a preliminary severity level (SEV).
    -   Declare an incident in the designated communication channel (e.g., a dedicated Slack channel `#security-incidents`).
    -   Assign Incident Commander (IC).

### Phase 2: Containment

The goal is to stop the bleeding and prevent further damage. Actions are taken based on the incident type.

-   **Isolate the affected system**: Use network ACLs or firewall rules to block traffic to/from the compromised resource.
-   **Rotate credentials**: Immediately rotate any keys, passwords, or service account credentials that may have been compromised. Our `security` Terraform module can be used to generate new secrets.
-   **Disable user accounts**: If an account is compromised, disable it immediately.
-   **Take snapshots**: Before making changes, take snapshots of affected disks and memory for forensic analysis.

### Phase 3: Eradication

The goal is to remove the root cause of the incident.

-   **Identify the vulnerability**: Analyze logs, system state, and forensic data to understand how the attacker gained access.
-   **Patch the vulnerability**: Deploy a fix for the identified security flaw. For infrastructure, this means updating the relevant Terraform code and running it through the CI/CD pipeline.
-   **Scan for persistence mechanisms**: Ensure the attacker has not left backdoors or other ways to regain access.
-   **Rebuild from a known-good state**: If a system cannot be trusted, it must be destroyed and rebuilt from scratch using our Terraform configurations.

### Phase 4: Recovery

The goal is to restore service to a fully operational and secure state.

-   **Restore services**: Bring the patched and hardened systems back online.
-   **Validate functionality**: Run integration tests and perform manual QA to ensure the system is operating as expected.
-   **Monitor closely**: Increase monitoring on the affected systems to watch for any signs of recurrence. The `monitoring` module's alerts are critical here.

### Phase 5: Post-Incident Review (Postmortem)

This is the most critical phase for long-term improvement.

1.  **Schedule a blameless postmortem** within 3-5 business days of the incident's resolution.
2.  **Create a timeline** of events: detection, key actions, resolution.
3.  **Analyze the root cause(s)**.
4.  **Identify what went well** and what could be improved in the response process.
5.  **Create actionable follow-up items** with owners and due dates to improve security posture and response procedures.

## 4. Communication Plan

-   **Internal**: A dedicated Slack channel (`#security-incidents`) will be the single source of truth during an incident. The Communications Lead will provide regular, brief updates to stakeholders.
-   **External**: For SEV-1 or SEV-2 incidents involving customer data or widespread outages, a customer-facing communication plan will be enacted. All external communication must be approved by leadership.

*This plan is a living document and should be reviewed and updated quarterly or after any significant security incident.*
